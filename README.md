# redux-snack-list

## To-Do's

[X] Create a new React app with create-react-app
[X] Bring in redux and react-redux
[X] Set up your store and Provider
[X] Create an input form component that allows the user to add a snack (as a string) to an array.
[X] This form will dispatch an action and run a reducer. This reducer needs to add this new item to an array of snack items.
[X] Display this list of snacks on the DOM with another component called SnackList.

### Style Mode
[ ] Bring in Material UI. Style and layout the app using it.

### Stretch Goals
[X] Break the above into components for the form and the display if you have not already done so.
[X] Add a subcomponent for a SnackItem to display each snack.
[ ] Add another input for the name of the person who provided the snack. Make sure this shows up on the DOM as well.
